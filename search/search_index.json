It is designed to be a private, offline, and secure alternative to cloud-based AI assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. A Neon Hub can run on any consumer computer built within the last 5 years, running the Linux operating system, and can be accessed from any device on the same network.</p> <p>Neon Hub is designed to be easy to set up and use, with a web interface for managing services and a RESTful API for developers. Future versions of the Hub will include a web interface for managing API keys and other settings, plus an ISO image for easy installation.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>A GPU is not required and is currently not supported, but future versions will support GPU acceleration.</p> <p>A Neon Hub can be used with any number of Neon Nodes, which can be as small as a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Nodes can be placed throughout a home, office, or business, and can be used to interact with the Hub using voice commands, text, or a web interface. The Hub can be used to control smart home devices, answer questions, play music, and more.</p> <p>Neon Hub is perfect for:</p> <ul> <li>Privacy-conscious individuals</li> <li>Retail kiosks</li> <li>Municipalities</li> <li>Educational institutions</li> <li>Hospitals</li> <li>Hotels</li> </ul>"},{"location":"configuration/","title":"Configuration","text":"<p>More configuration information is available in the Neon documentation.</p> <p>All configuration is done in the <code>neon.yaml</code> file.
