# Neon Hub

Neon Hub is a central server for artificial intelligence, powered by Neon AIÂ®. It is designed to be a private, offline, and secure alternative to cloud-based AI assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. A Neon Hub can run on any consumer computer built within the last 5 years, running the Linux operating system, and can be accessed from any device on the same network. Neon Hub is designed to be easy to set up and use, with a web interface for managing services and a RESTful API for developers. A GPU is not required and is currently not supported, but future versions will support GPU acceleration.

A Neon Hub can be used with any number of Neon Nodes, which can be as small as a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Nodes can be placed throughout a home or office, and can be used to interact with the Hub using voice commands, text, or a web interface. The Hub can be used to control smart home devices, answer questions, play music, and more.

Neon Hub is perfect for:

- Privacy-conscious individuals
- Retail kiosks
- Municipalities
- Educational institutions
- Hospitals
- Hotels
