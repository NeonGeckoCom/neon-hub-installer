# Installation

!!! info
    tl;dr run this script:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NeonGeckoCom/neon-hub-installer
    cd neon-hub-installer
    sudo ./neon-hub-installer/installer.sh
    ```

Clone the installer repository (`git clone https://github.com/NeonGeckoCom/neon-hub-installer`) and run `sudo ./installer.sh`. It will install prerequisites, then take you through a guided setup process.

For most users, the default settings will be sufficient.
