show_message "Welcome to the Neon Hub installer! 

Neon Hub is a central server for artificial intelligence, powered by Neon AIÂ®. It is designed to be a private, offline, and secure alternative to cloud-based AI assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. 

This installer will guide you through the process of setting up a Neon Hub on your computer. You will need to have a working internet connection and a computer running Linux. The installer will install all necessary dependencies, set up a Docker environment, and configure Neon Hub to run as services.

If you are unsure about any of the options, you can press enter to use the default value."

show_message "Your message queue secrets and Neon Node secret are available in ${PWD}/ansible/neon_hub_secrets.yaml. Please keep these secrets safe and do not share them with anyone. You will need these secrets to connect to your Neon Hub.

Neon Hub is ready to use! To begin, say \"Hey Neon\" and ask a question such as \"What time is it?\" or \"What's the weather like today?\"."

show_message "You can check your Neon Hub services by navigating to https://yacht.${HOSTNAME} in your preferred web browser. It is also available at http://$IP:8000. The default credentials are admin@yacht.local:pass.

Please note that the first time you access the web interface, you will need to accept the self-signed SSL certificate. You can do this in most browsers by clicking \"Advanced\" and then \"Proceed to ${HOSTNAME}\".

Congratulations on setting up your Neon Hub! Enjoy your new AI server!"
